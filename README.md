# Clockwork Collapse

### What is this project?
I created this project as my first personal project on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev).
As I have always been interested in game development and I only know python a text-based game seemed like a viable option.

The game is mostly a CYOA style game at the moment. Seeing as it is my first project I figured I would create a demo first and maybe once I am more developed (*get it?*) as a programmer continue on making a full game.

### What did I learn?
I didn't know anything about Tkinter or creating windows in python. It was quite a struggle to begin with but once I got the hang of it, it was really rewarding and fun to see all the different kinds of things you can do with it.

I also learned that writing a text-based game is tedious as hell and writing scenes is also a struggle so please forgive me, I did use a little AI with the story and scene writing. The point of the project was the code anyway.
Most of the AI usage is helping me brainstorm and asking me questions about where I want the story to go. I figured I'd be transparent about that.

### How to play
Either clone the repo and just run main.py
or check out the [itch.io page](https://fezbot.itch.io/clockwork-collapse)

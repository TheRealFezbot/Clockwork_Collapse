# Clockwork Collapse

## About the Project
**Clockwork Collapse** is my first personal project created during my time on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev). I’ve always been interested in game development, and since Python is currently my strongest language, building a **text-based game** felt like the perfect place to start.

At the moment, the game is mainly a **Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA)** experience. Because this is my first larger project, I focused on creating a **small demo** rather than a full game. The idea is to potentially expand it in the future as my skills continue to develop (yes, that pun was intended).

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists as a **learning-focused first step into game development**. Rather than following a tutorial or copying an existing project, I wanted to build something from scratch that forced me to think about structure, state management, UI, and player interaction.

The goal wasn’t to create a perfect or complete game, but to:
- Learn by doing  
- Make mistakes and refactor  
- Ship something playable  
- Gain confidence working on a larger, self-directed project  

## What I Learned
Going into this project, I had **no experience with Tkinter** or creating graphical windows in Python. The learning curve was pretty steep at first, but once things started to click, it became incredibly rewarding to see the game come together visually.

I also learned that writing a text-based game is **a lot more work than it looks**. Creating scenes, choices, and consistent story flow is surprisingly difficult. For that reason, I did use a small amount of AI assistance for story and scene writing. This was mainly for brainstorming and helping me think through narrative options — the primary focus of this project is the **code**, and I wanted to be transparent about that.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** – core game logic and application structure  
- **Tkinter** – graphical user interface and window management  
- **JSON serialization** – save and load system for persistent player state  
- **File I/O** – reading and writing save data to disk  
- **Standalone build** – packaged executable distributed via itch.io  

## Features
- Text-based **Choose Your Own Adventure** gameplay  
- Graphical user interface built with **Tkinter**  
- Branching story paths influenced by player choices  
- **Player state system** with persistent flags and story variables  
- **Save and load functionality** to continue progress  
- Available as a **standalone executable** via itch.io  
- Modular code structure designed for future expansion  
- Runs locally with no external dependencies beyond Python  

## Roadmap
Planned ideas and possible future improvements:
- Expand the story with additional branches and endings  
- Improve UI layout and visual feedback  
- Add an **inventory system**  
- Introduce basic **player stats or attributes**  
- Refactor and clean up code as skills improve  

## How to Play
You can play the game in one of two ways:
- Download and run the **standalone executable** from the [itch.io page](https://fezbot.itch.io/clockwork-collapse)
- Clone the repository and run `main.py`  

## Feedback
Feedback is very welcome! If you have constructive criticism, ideas for improvement, or suggestions for future features, I’d love to hear them.
